<center><b>Bubberstation uses donor funds to run the server, and develop the game. </b></center>
<center><i>Public logging, job exemptions, and many other features were funded by Bubberstation donors.</i></center> 
<center>If you want to contribute to that, and keep us able to make great changes, check out our ko-fi <a href="https://ko-fi.com/bubberhost"><b>here.</b></a> In exchange, we run monthly art raffles for our donors. It's not much, but it's our way of giving back. </center>
