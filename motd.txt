<b>The Reverie Colony</b>

From now until the end of the event series, the Reverie Colony will be available as an interactable, additional entity! To speak to someone at the colony, send a fax or a message to Central Command. You may request materials, supplies or other items, in exchange for things the colony needs. You may, if you'd like, even just talk to them, send them faxes, ask for information or chat. This will probably come in more useful later during other events, but you are free to do so during normal rounds. Look out for small bits of lore or information about the colony during these normal rounds too!
